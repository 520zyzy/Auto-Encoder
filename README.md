# Convolutional Auto-Encoder





# Variational Auto-Encoder

We show the completely continuous distribution of different number categories in the VAE algorithm. When you observe along a path in the latent space, you will observe that one number gradually becomes another. The specific direction of this space has a certain meaning.
